            <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold">Introduction</h2>
            <p className="mt-3 text-2xl">Hi! I’m a web developer and I love all things tech. When I’m not knee-deep in code, I’m probably reading up on the latest development trends or practicing my sketching (or both).

                I got my start in technology as a self-taught coder, and since then I’ve never looked back. I specialize in front-end development, but I have a little bit of experience with everything from coding to QA to project management.

                I’m always looking for new challenges and opportunities, and I’m excited to see what the future holds for me in the world of tech. Thanks for reading!</p>

            <p className="mt-3 text-xl">When it comes to writing my web developer technical bio, I like to focus on my skills and experience. I want to make it clear to potential employers or clients what I am capable of and what I can bring to the table.

                I have a strong background in web development, having worked as both a front-end and back-end developer for several years. My skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, NodeJS, PHP, and MySQL. I am also familiar with popular frameworks such as Bootstrap and Laravel.

                In addition to my technical skills, I am also experienced in project management and have worked on projects from start to finish. I am able to take ownership of a project and see it through to completion, ensuring that all deadlines are met and that the end product is of the highest quality.

                I believe that my skills and experience make me an excellent candidate for any web development role, and I look forward to putting my talents to good use!</p>
